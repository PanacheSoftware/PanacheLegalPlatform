## Project build status

![Platform Build](https://github.com/PanacheSoftware/PanacheLegalPlatform/workflows/Platform%20Build/badge.svg)

## Branches

Main Branch is current.

## Panache Legal Platform

Panache Legal is a complete open source LegalTech platform available to use with unlimited users for no licence fee.

## Pre-Alpha

Panache Legal is currently in early alpha and is not suitable for production environments, it should only be used for early testing.

You should expect missing or incomplete features/functionality with the potential for data loss during upgrades.

## Issues

With the project currently being in an early pre-alpha stage many components are in active development and functionality may change reguarly.  If you find aspects that do not work as expected, or bugs and missing functionality, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/PanacheSoftware/PanacheLegalPlatform/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/PanacheSoftware/PanacheLegalPlatform/projects) pages to check if those items are already logged and being worked on before creating a new issue.

## Documentation

For project documentation please visit [ReadTheDocs](https://panachelegal.readthedocs.io/).

I've also written a [dev.to guide](https://dev.to/panachesoftwaredev/making-a-local-microk8s-environment-available-externally-part-1-building-a-linux-vm-1n3d) which details how to get your own environment up and running using MicroK8s.

## Docker

All services and the standard user interface are distributed via Docker Images for easy installation and setup.  See the Panache Software [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/panachesoftware) site and the examples on [ReadTheDocs](https://panachelegal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gettingstarted/0_docker.html) for setup information.
